<h2> 9.11.22 </h2>
* Yesterday I went to the founders and coders meet up to discuss the projects and get to know other people
* It was REALLY good fun! 
* With the help of the mentors, I realised that in this code I call the 'submit' twice and they both do two different things --> once from the form and once with the button 
* As JS is newer to me than HTML and CSS, i have used a plethora of resources to try and work the code for this, however in doing so it's led to me getting confused on what action is doing what
* As of right now, I'm going to leave the code as is and have a think before coming back to it
* I am also going to google child appendages (to see if I can just get several comments on the page at one time)

<h2>Current issues</h2>
* only submitting one comment 
* formatting that comment and writing bits around it to explain ie EMAIL: NAME:
* form validation with JS (it'll still submit the form even if char limit is over or the email isn't the right format)
* resetting the character limit immediately after submitting
