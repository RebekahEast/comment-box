<h3 align = "center"><b>About the Project</h3></b>
<p align = "center">Hello! This project allows people to comment on the page using a submit button. The page will take as many comments as the person submits, however the page will refresh back to 0 when reloaded. </p><br>

<p align = "center">This project was a great way to test my CSS and HTML knowledge, as well as pushing my Javascript knowledge further. I specifically designed this website to look neutral, so that a user could insert the comment box onto their website and have it look the same style as the whole page.</p><br>

<h3 align = "center"><b>Key Learnings</h3></b>

<p align = "center"> I have to admit, this project pushed my Javascript knowledge to the maximum! I did a lot of learning, which was really fun! I also used this time to console.log() and check what JS was doing and when.</p><br>

<p align = "center"> This project allowed me to think harder about how HTML and Javascript interact, and how to change the data from the webpage with Javascript.</em></p><br>

<h3 align = "center"><b>Thing's I'd love to improve on</h3></b>
<p align = "center">1. Having the date and time of the comment appear when the comment is submitted<br><br>
2. My project unfortunately has an issue with the number of characters. If you go over the limit of word count, you can't submit (GREAT!) but then if you remove some and go under, I can't get the comment to be able to be submitted again.. The page has to be refreshed<br><br>
3. I would have liked to have more validation like name can't have a number or special char<br><br>

<h3 align = "center"><b>Days of Note</h3></b>
<p align = "center"> <b>15.11.22 </b></p>
<p align = "center">things left to do<br>
1. the word count will prevent the form from sending but wont remove after the word count is reduced back below the maximum <br>
2. form validation <br><br></p>

1. Yesterday I went to the founders and coders meet up to discuss this project and get to know other people<br>
2. It was REALLY good fun!<br>
3. With the help of the mentors, I realised that in this code I call the 'submit' twice and they both do two different things --> once from the form and once with the button <br>
4. As JS is newer to me than HTML and CSS, i have used a plethora of resources to try and work the code for this, however in doing so it's led to me getting confused on what action is doing what <br>
5. As of right now, I'm going to leave the code as is and have a think before coming back to it <br>
6. I am also going to google child appendages (to see if I can just get several comments on the page at one time)</p>
