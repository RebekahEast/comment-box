# comment-box
comment form for a website


Current issues
- only submitting one comment 
- formatting that comment and writing bits around it to explain ie EMAIL: NAME:
- form validation with JS (it'll still submit the form even if char limit is over or the email isn't the right format)
- resetting the character limit immediately after submitting
