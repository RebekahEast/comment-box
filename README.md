<h3 align = "center"><b>About the Project</h3></b>
<p align = "center">Hello! This project allows people to comment on the page using a submit button. The page will take as many comments as the person submits, however the page will refresh back to 0 when reloaded. </p><br>

<p align = "center">This project was a great way to test my CSS and HTML knowledge, as well as pushing my Javascript knowledge further. I specifically designed this website to look neutral, so that a user could insert the comment box onto their website and have it look the same style as the whole page.</p><br>

<h3 align = "center"><b>Key Learnings</h3></b>

<p align = "center"> I have to admit, this project pushed my Javascript knowledge to the maximum! I did a lot of learning, which was really fun! I also used this time to console.log() and check what JS was doing and when.</p><br>

<p align = "center"> This project allowed me to think harder about how HTML and Javascript interact, and how to change the data from the webpage with Javascript.</em></p><br>

<h3 align = "center"><b>Thing's I'd love to improve on</h3></b>
<p align = "center">1. Having the date and time of the comment appear when the comment is submitted<br><br>
2. <br><br>
3. <br><br>

<h2 align = "center"> 9.11.22 </h2>
<p align = "center">* Yesterday I went to the founders and coders meet up to discuss this project and get to know other people
* It was REALLY good fun! 
* With the help of the mentors, I realised that in this code I call the 'submit' twice and they both do two different things --> once from the form and once with the button 
* As JS is newer to me than HTML and CSS, i have used a plethora of resources to try and work the code for this, however in doing so it's led to me getting confused on what action is doing what
* As of right now, I'm going to leave the code as is and have a think before coming back to it
* I am also going to google child appendages (to see if I can just get several comments on the page at one time)</p>
